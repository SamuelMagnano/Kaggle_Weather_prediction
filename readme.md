# Kaggle - Weather Prediction Given Minimum Temperature 


## Request
Is there a relationship between the daily minimum and maximum temperature? Can you predict the maximum temperature given the minimum temperature ?

## Dataset description
We are given two datasets: 
- the first containing weather conditions registered from specific weather stations around the world during world war II
- the second specifying parameters like latitude/longitude/altitude for each given weather station

This has been one of my first exercises on data cleaning, aggregation and visualization other than comparing and testing a few machine learning models on the dataset i obtain.
